## Why use DBeaver
* You can manage all popular databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Oracle, DB2, SQL Server, MS Access, Teradata, Firebird, Apache Hive, Phoenix, Presto, etc) in one single tool. No need to download separate tool for each type of database
* The community edition of DBeaver is free
* This is tool is cross-platform, so it can be installed in Windows, Linux, Mac

## Install DBeaver
#### Windows
* Download DBeaver at https://dbeaver.io/download/
* Run the installer and complete the installation

#### Ubuntu
```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:serge-rider/dbeaver-ce
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install dbeaver-ce
```
#### Other Linux Distributions
The DBeaver download page at https://dbeaver.io/download/ has the commands and instructions required to install in other environments also like Debian, Mac OS, RPM etc

### Using DBeaver

* Each type of database connection requires its own plugin
* If plugin is not present in the computer, DBeaver will prompt to install the plugins via downloading from the internet
