In this post we are going to learn about how to use jupyter notebooks in Visual Studio Code

### Why the Jupyter Notebooks approach
* Jupyter notebooks is the way to go approach for experimenting and debugging with python code or execute code in small parts while developing it.
* Each part of a code is called a **cell** in a Jupyter notebook
* Jupyter notebooks can also be used to graphically visualize the variables using the variable explorer.
* One more use case of jupyter notebooks is that you can load data into variables and then play with them as many times as you wish by changing the code. 
This is particularly useful if you load huge data into your variables

### Add Jupyter notebooks feature to existing python code
![jupyter_notebook_py_file](https://github.com/nagasudhirpulla/taming_python/raw/master/blog/skills/assets/img/jupyter_notebook_py_file.png)
* As shown in the image above, just add `# %%` in the line above  your code to make it a jupyter notebook cell
* The cell controls like Run Cell, Run Above will automatically displayed by Visual Studio Code
* Upon  running the cells in python file, we will get to see output in the right-side output pane. An example image is shown below
