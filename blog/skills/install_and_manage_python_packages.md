Please make sure to have all the skills mentioned above to understand and execute the code mentioned below. Go through the above skills if necessary for reference or revision

### Main Code
* **if** condition runs a code only if the supplied expression evaluates to ```True```. For Example
```python
x = 5
# the print statement will execute since x is 5
if x==5:	
	print('The value of x is 5')

# the print statement will not execute since x is not 10
if x==10:
	print('The value of x is 10')
```
* **else** can be used to execute when if condition is supplied with value that evaluates to false. For example
```python
x=10
if x==5:	
	print('The value of x is 5')
else:
	print('The value of x is not 5')
```
