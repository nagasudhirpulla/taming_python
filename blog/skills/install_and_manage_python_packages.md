### Why virtual environments
* Each installed python package has a particular version number.
* Sometimes we may desire to have different version numbers of the same package for different python projects (may be due to compatibility issues).
* This can be solved by creating a virtual environment and using it in our project

### Introduction
* A virtual environment has its own python packages isolated from the default system python environment and its installed packages
* This way we can manage the packages installed and their version numbers and use it in our projects
