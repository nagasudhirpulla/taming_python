<hr/>
In this post we will install Oracle Instant Client that enables communication between python scripts and oracle database.

## Why use Oracle Instant Client
* Without Oracle Instant Client configured properly, python scripts cannot communicate with the oracle database.

## When is Instant Client not required
* If you computer that is running the python scripts already has Oracle database installed in it, Instant Client may not be required.
* But there can be cases where the Oracle is 32 bit and python is 64 bit or vice-versa, where Instant Client installation will be necessary even if Oracle Database is installed in the computer.

## Downloading the Instant Client
* Download Oracle Instant Client from https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/instant-client/downloads.html or search for "Oracle Instant Client download" if this link does not work
* Download the relevant zip file by clicking on the link like "Instant Client for Microsoft Windows (x64)"
