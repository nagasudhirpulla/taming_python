# Generate a static website from python flask application using Frozen-Flask

## What is a static website

-   A static website will deliver the content as is to the client with out any server-side rendering
-   For example, a static website can just serve HTML, JavaScript and CSS files

## Where can static websites be used

-   Static websites can be used for websites where user inputs are not required. For example, an organizationâ€™s website, resume website, portfolio websites etc

## Why use a static website

-   Static websites are more secure with reduced attack surface since there is no scope for user input
-   Static websites are easy to maintain and do not require more software to be installed on the server
-   Static websites do not require databases
-   Static websites can be easily hosted in robust, secure and performant web servers like IIS, apache2, nginx etc

## What is frozen flask

-   Frozen flask python module can be used to convert a python flask application into files which can be hosted as static website
-   Hence python is also not required to host website

## Why use frozen flask

-   jinja templates in flask applications can facilitate re-usability in webpages. For example, a base HTML file with header, footer, menu etc., can be used in all website pages using jinja template `extends` and `block` as shown below. This can help in organizing the website content easily

```html
{% extends "base.html" %}
{% block title %}Contact{% endblock %}
{% block body %}
<div class="jumbotron">
  <h1>The Contact Page</h1>
  <p class="lead">Feel free to leave us a message at <a href="abc@xyz.com">abc@xyz.com</a></p>
</div>
{% endblock %}

```

-   flask applications use routes, url_generators, blueprints for segregation and maintenance of webpages

## Install frozen flask

-   Run the following command to install the frozen-flask python module

```bash
python -m pip install Frozen-Flask

```

## Sample flask application

-   Below is a simple python flask application in a variable named `app`

```python
# app/__init__.py
from flask import Flask, render_template

# Initialize the app
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template("index.html")

@app.route('/about/')
def about():
    return render_template("about.html")

@app.route('/contact/')
def contact():
    return render_template("contact.html")

@app.route('/terms/')
def terms():
    return render_template("terms.html")

```

-   The server (variable named `app`) can can be run with python for testing as shown below

```python
# run.py
from app import app
import os

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host="localhost", port=50100, debug=True)

```

-   The server can be converted into files using frozen-flask python module as shown below. The files will be generated into a folder named `build` next to `static` and `templates` folders. These `build` folder files can be hosted as a static website

```python
# freeze.py
from flask_frozen import Freezer
from app import app

freezer = Freezer(app)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    freezer.freeze()

```

## Declaring routes in the flask server

-   Make sure to declare the routes with `/` at the end so that index.html file will be statically generated in the respective routes folder
-   For example, declare a route as `/about/` so that the static file be generated in the path `/about/index.html`
-   Otherwise each route should be named with `.html` at the end. For example, the flask route should be defined as `/about.html` instead of `/about`
