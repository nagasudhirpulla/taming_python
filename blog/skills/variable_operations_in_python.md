#### Skills Required
* [Setup python development environment](https://nagasudhir.blogspot.com/2020/04/setup-python-development-environment_14.html)
* [Basic Printing in Python](https://nagasudhir.blogspot.com/2020/04/basic-printing-in-python.html)

* [Managing Variables in python](https://nagasudhir.blogspot.com/2020/04/managing-variables-in-python.html)

Please make sure to go through all the skills mentioned above to understand and execute the code mentioned below

### Main Code
Boolean means ```True/False```. For example
```python
x = False
y = True
```
In the above code the variable x is assigned a boolean value ```True``` and y is assigned a boolean value ```False```

#### == Operator 
* **==** operator can be used to compare values on both sides and returns True only if both sides are equal. For example
```python
# assign value to variables
x = 10
y = 15

# this will print False
print(x==y)

# this will print True
print(x+5 == y)
```
