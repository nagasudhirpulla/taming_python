In this post, we will learn how to distribute our python program as `.exe` file

Sometimes the computer in which the python code has to run 
* may not have python installed in it
* may not have  internet to install python
* may not have additional package dependencies
* may have conflicting versions of python libraries

All the above issues in python code deployment can be solved by distributing our python code along with python and its dependencies as an independent folder with `.exe` file to run the code.

This can be done using the `pyinstaller` package

To install it, run the command `pip install pyinstaller` in command prompt.
