When a line in python starts with ```#```, python will not execute the line.
 So you can write any thing in a comment.

For example consider the following python code
```python
# This is comment which won't be executed
# Let's print Hello World!
print('Hello World!')
```
The first two lines in the above code are comments, since they start with a ```#``` .H  ence will not be executed by python
