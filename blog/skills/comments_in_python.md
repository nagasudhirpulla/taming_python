## Skill - Comments in python

#### Skills Required
* [Setup python development environment](https://nagasudhir.blogspot.com/2020/04/setup-python-development-environment_14.html)

#### Explanation
When a line in python starts with ```#```, python will not execute the line.
 So you can write any thing in a comment.

For example consider the following python code
```python
# This is comment which won't be executed
# Let's print Hello World!
print('Hello World!')
```
* The first two lines in the above code are comments, since they start with ```#``` 
* Hence the first 2 lines will not be executed by python
