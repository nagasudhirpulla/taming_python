## Skill - Comments in python

#### Skills Required
* [Setup python development environment](https://nagasudhir.blogspot.com/2020/04/setup-python-development-environment_14.html)
* [Basic Printing in Python](https://nagasudhir.blogspot.com/2020/04/basic-printing-in-python.html)

Please make sure to go through all the skills mentioned above to understand and execute the code mentioned below

#### Main Code
When a line in python starts with ```#```, python will not execute the line.
 So you can write any thing in a comment.

For example consider the following python code
```python
# This is a comment which won't be executed
# Let's print Hello World!
print('Hello World!')
```
* The first two lines in the above code are comments, since they start with ```#``` 
* Hence the first 2 lines will not be executed by python

Multi-line comments example are shown below. Multi-line comments are useful to write comments in more lines
```python
"""  
This is a comment  
written in  
more than just one line  
"""
print('Hello World!')
```

#### Run this in Visual Studio Code
* Create a folder in your PC
* Open this folder in Visual Studio Code using menu _File->Open Folder_
* Open _File Explorer_
* Create a python file by any name, say ```hello.py``` and write the following
```python
# This is a comment which won't be executed
# Let's print Hello World!
print("Hello world!")
```
* Run the code using menu _Run -> Run Without Debugging_
* You should see __Hello world!__ printed in the terminal
* Notice the the first 2 lines are not executed since they are comments
