**Matplotlib** is a plotting library tn the scipy ecosystem of libraries.

Please make sure that you covered the [post on basics](https://nagasudhir.blogspot.com/2020/05/intro-to-matplotlib.html)

Sometimes we may require to have the main axis lines to be intersecting at (0,0) of the subplot. We will control the positioning of `spines` to achieve this.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
x = [-5, -4, 5, 8]
y = [-6, 5, 8,-10]

# create a plotting area and get the figure, axes handle in return
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# plot data on the axes handle
ax.plot(x, y)

# Move left y-axis and bottim x-axis to centre by setting position as 'center'
ax.spines['left'].set_position('zero')
ax.spines['bottom'].set_position('zero')

# Eliminate top and right axes by setting spline color as 'none'
ax.spines['right'].set_color('none')
ax.spines['top'].set_color('none')

# print the plot
plt.show()
```

As shown above the spines/axis lines of an axes handle `ax` can be controlled by `ax.spines`

If we want the axis lines to be intersecting at center of the subplot instead of (0,0). 

In such case we can use the following 
```python
ax.spines['left'].set_position('center')
ax.spines['bottom'].set_position('center')
```
The output would be like the image below
