Sir

We were unable to get Powertel internet since 1 PM today.
We did not get any confirmation or response from Powertel after logging the complaint.
When we called after 6 hrs, we got a response that the issue may be at our end.
As per LOA 99 % availability is needed.
This issue may result in deduction of payment in case the link is down for this much time.
Please look into this issue as soon as possible

regards
