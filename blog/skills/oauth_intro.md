## What is OAuth 2.0
- OAuth 2.0 specification centralizes authentication and access information in a Centralized Identity server / Secure Token Service (STS)
- Identity server can authenticate users or applications and issue tokens to them for getting access to the secured resources in the resource server
- The identity and access rights information of users or applications will be centrally stored in the identity server / Secure Token Service (STS)
- Since user or application gets authenticated at an identity server for getting access to resources in one or multiple resource servers, Single-Sign-On (SSO) is implementable using OAuth 2.0
