Please make sure to have all the skills mentioned above to understand and execute the code mentioned below

### Main Code
#### Assigning value to a variable
```python
x = 1
y = 'abc'
```
The code above assigns the value 1 to variable x and assigns the value 'abc' to variable y

#### Deleting variables
```python
del x
```
The above code deletes the variable x

### Get type of the variable
```python
x = 1
print(type(x))
```
The above code will print ```<type 'int'>```

### Some other operations
```python
x = 2

# this makes value of y as 4 as x is multiplied by 2
y = 2*x

# this makes value of z as 6 as the addition of x and y is assigned to z
z = x + y
```
